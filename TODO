Backbone.js numbers (passing tests):

React:
```
        raw      raw win gzip    gzip win parse time
babel   174.21kB 260%    52.91kB 168%     16ms
closure 171.46kB 265%    52.97kB 168%     13ms
uglify  176.41kB 255%    53.18kB 167%     13ms
```

Look into merging into if statements again (last time it was bad for gzip) (make sure that sqeuence expressions are not parenthesized in if statements by babel)
